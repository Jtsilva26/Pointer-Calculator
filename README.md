# Pointer-Calculator
Uses pointers to do basic calculations

```
void getNum(int *a, int *b)
```
Takes two int pointers as the params. Does a simple cout and assigns them to the pointer values which is the reference to the int values in main.

```
void calc(int *a, int *b)
```
Takes two int pointers as the params. Then takes the input and assigns it to the character op and is put into a switch case checking the value used for op.
